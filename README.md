Summary of progress:
I’ve accomplished the simple UI wireframes that I’ve sketched out in my proposal and implement the use state for these. I’m struggling with writing the request for the api  because I feel like the documentation isn’t the most straightforward. I’ve consulted a few Youtube videos to see how other people have implemented it but it seems that I’m lacking the understanding of the syntax to establish the call myself. I believe I need to understand this first before moving onto implementing the rest of my application.
